AkoshaDashboard
===============
This app can be used to pull all feeds from any Facebook Brand page and gives a provision to user to reply on the behalf of a 
page if user is having Admin permissions.
Currently there are two extra files Brand.java and Status_Comments.java. They are not getting used any where.You can escape these two files.
To run this project, user has to put this application in Apache tomcat server.
Spring MVC has been used in this application , so user must have all Spring MVC required jars to run this project.
First page application will display is welcome.jsp
After successfully login with facebook,user will be displayed postlogin.jsp.
Then on this page, user can enter any brand page name and can get all the feeds on this page.

If anyone comes across any issues or if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. 
I am open to discuss .
